# project of deep learning parameters effect on the training
Coding trials to see the effect of parameters' changes on the training process in deep learning.
### Problem Definition: 
Predict  the type of the traffic to the network whether it is normal traffic or one of the five possible attacks (predict the type of the attack) through multi-layer perceptron. 

### Different types of attacks:

TCP-SYN Flood attacks.

Port scan attacks.

Flow Table Overflow attacks.

Blackhole attacks.

Traffic Diversion attacks.
